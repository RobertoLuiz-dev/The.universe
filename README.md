The Universe leaves the field of static pages with the Single Page Application. Each of the 3 sections of the navigation bar (''Home'', ''The Universe'' and ''Exploration'' - and there could be as many more as you wanted) brings different content and background. The NavBar also has hover and animation, and there is even a really cool section to indicate an ''error404/nonexistent path''.
